# Enigma Machine Simulator

# üîê Enigma Machine 

The **Enigma machine** was a cipher device used by the German military during **World War II** to send secret messages. It worked like a typewriter but scrambled letters in a complex way, making messages unreadable‚Äîunless you knew the secret settings.

## üìú How Does the Enigma Machine Work?

Imagine you want to send a secret message, like:  
üëâ **"HELLO"**  

If you type **H** on the Enigma machine, it wouldn‚Äôt show H. Instead, it might show **X**.  
If you typed **E**, it might show **M**.  

By the time your whole message was typed, it would look like complete nonsense! But if the person on the other side had the **same machine set up with the same settings**, they could decode the message and read it properly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanics of the Enigma Machine

The machine used **three main components** to encrypt messages:

1. **Rotors** ‚Äì These spinning wheels changed each letter to another. After every keypress, they moved, making the encryption even more complex.
2. **Plugboard** ‚Äì A customizable switchboard that swapped letters. For example, every **A** could become **T**, and every **B** could become **K**.
3. **Reflector** ‚Äì This bounced signals back through the rotors, adding another layer of scrambling.

Since the **rotor positions and plugboard settings changed daily**, the code was extremely difficult to crack.

## üîë Why Was Enigma Important?

The Germans believed Enigma was **unbreakable**, but a team of Polish mathematicians and later **British codebreakers (including Alan Turing)** cracked it. This allowed the Allies to read German military plans in secret, playing a major role in winning the war.

## Summary
This project is a Python-based simulation of the historic **Enigma Machine**, a cipher device famously used during World War II for secure communication. The simulator replicates the encryption and decryption process of the Enigma Machine, providing a hands-on way to understand its mechanics and historical significance in cryptography.

### Key Features:
- **Rotor Mechanism:** Simulates the rotation and substitution process of the Enigma rotors.
- **Plugboard Functionality:** Allows character mapping for additional encryption complexity.
- **Reversible Encryption:** Ensures the same configuration can decrypt the encoded message.

### Usage Instructions:
1. Extract the provided file into your working directory.
2. Execute the MAIN.py to start the simulation:
   

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand the foundational principles of symmetric key cryptography.
