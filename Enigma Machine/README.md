# Enigma Machine Simulator

## Summary
This project is a Python-based simulation of the historic **Enigma Machine**, a cipher device famously used during World War II for secure communication. The simulator replicates the encryption and decryption process of the Enigma Machine, providing a hands-on way to understand its mechanics and historical significance in cryptography.

### Key Features:
- **Rotor Mechanism:** Simulates the rotation and substitution process of the Enigma rotors.
- **Plugboard Functionality:** Allows character mapping for additional encryption complexity.
- **Reversible Encryption:** Ensures the same configuration can decrypt the encoded message.

### Usage Instructions:
1. Extract the provided file into your working directory.
2. Execute the MAIN.py to start the simulation:
   

### Learning Objectives:
- Understand the foundational principles of symmetric key cryptography.
- Explore how mechanical encryption devices laid the groundwork for modern cryptographic methods.
- Appreciate the historical role of cryptography in wartime communication and security.
