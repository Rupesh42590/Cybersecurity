## üìã Requirements

### System Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Windows, Linux, or macOS
- Administrator/root privileges (required for SYN scanning and OS detection)

### Python Dependencies
All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`:
- `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy` - Numerical computing
- `scikit-learn` - Machine learning algorithms
- `matplotlib` - Data visualization
- `scapy` - Network packet manipulation (optional but recommended)

## üîß Installation

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd network-security-toolkit
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install packages individually:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib scapy
```

### 3. Platform-Specific Setup

#### Linux/macOS
```bash
# Install Scapy dependencies (if not automatically installed)
sudo apt-get install python3-dev libpcap-dev  # Ubuntu/Debian
# or
brew install libpcap  # macOS with Homebrew

# For full functionality, run with sudo
sudo python3 main.py
```

#### Windows
```bash
# Install Npcap (required for Scapy on Windows)
# Download from: https://nmap.org/npcap/

# Run Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator
python main.py
```

### 4. Optional: Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üö¶ Usage

### Starting the Application
```bash
python main.py
```

For advanced features (SYN scanning, OS detection):
```bash
sudo python main.py  # Linux/macOS
# or run as Administrator on Windows
```

### Tool 1: Vulnerability Scanner
1. Select option `1` from the main menu
2. Enter the target IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
3. Wait for the scan to complete
4. Review the vulnerability assessment report

**Example Output:**
```
[+] Port 22 (SSH) is open.
[+] Port 80 (HTTP) is open.

[*] Potential issues for SSH on Port 22:
  - Weak algorithms
  - Password-based authentication

[*] Potential issues for HTTP on Port 80:
  - Directory traversal
  - Outdated versions
```

### Tool 2: Traffic Analyzer
1. Select option `2` from the main menu
2. Prepare your network traffic CSV file with columns:
   - `Time` - Timestamp of the packet
   - `Source` - Source IP address
   - `Destination` - Destination IP address
   - `Protocol` - Protocol type (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
   - `Length` - Packet length
   - `Info` - Additional packet information
3. Enter the CSV filename (default: `TrafficData.csv`)
4. Review attack detection results and anomaly analysis

**Supported CSV Format:**
```csv
Time,Source,Destination,Protocol,Length,Info
1.234567,192.168.1.100:12345,192.168.1.1:80,TCP,60,GET /index.html
1.234568,192.168.1.100:12346,192.168.1.1:80,TCP,60,SYN
```

### Tool 3: Interactive Port Scanner
1. Select option `3` from the main menu
2. Enter target IP address
3. Specify port range (e.g., 1-1024)
4. Choose scan type:
   - TCP Connect (default, no special privileges required)
   - SYN Scan (requires root/admin privileges)
5. Enable/disable verbose output
6. Optionally perform OS detection
7. Save results if desired

**Example Scan:**
```
Target: 192.168.1.1
Port Range: 1-1000
Scan Type: TCP Connect
Results: 5 open ports found
- Port 22/TCP: Open (ssh)
- Port 80/TCP: Open (http)
- Port 443/TCP: Open (https)
```

## üìä Sample Data

### Traffic Analysis CSV Format
Your CSV file should contain network traffic data with the following structure:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Time | Packet timestamp | 1.234567 |
| Source | Source IP:Port | 192.168.1.100:12345 |
| Destination | Destination IP:Port | 192.168.1.1:80 |
| Protocol | Network protocol | TCP, UDP, ICMP |
| Length | Packet size in bytes | 60 |
| Info | Additional packet details | "GET /index.html" |

## üîí Security Considerations

### Permissions
- **SYN Scanning**: Requires root (Linux/macOS) or Administrator (Windows) privileges
- **OS Detection**: Requires elevated privileges for ICMP packet crafting
- **Regular Port Scanning**: Works with standard user privileges

### Legal Notice
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This toolkit is intended for:
- Educational purposes
- Authorized penetration testing
- Security assessment of your own networks
- Systems you have explicit permission to test

**Do NOT use this toolkit on networks or systems you don't own or lack explicit permission to test. Unauthorized network scanning may violate local laws and regulations.**

### Ethical Usage Guidelines
- Always obtain written permission before testing
- Use responsibly and within legal boundaries
- Respect network resources and avoid excessive scanning
- Report discovered vulnerabilities through proper channels

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Scapy Installation Problems
```bash
# Linux/macOS
pip install --upgrade scapy
sudo apt-get install python3-dev libpcap-dev

# Windows
# Install Npcap from https://nmap.org/npcap/
pip install --upgrade scapy
```

#### Permission Denied Errors
```bash
# Linux/macOS - Run with sudo for SYN scanning
sudo python3 main.py

# Windows - Run Command Prompt as Administrator
```

#### CSV Loading Issues
- Ensure CSV file exists in the same directory as `main.py`
- Check CSV format matches expected columns
- Verify file is not corrupted or locked by another application

#### No Open Ports Found
- Verify target IP is reachable: `ping <target_ip>`
- Check if firewall is blocking scans
- Try scanning well-known ports first (22, 80, 443)
- Ensure target system is powered on and network-accessible

### Error Messages
| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Scapy not available" | Install scapy: `pip install scapy` |
| "Permission denied" | Run with sudo/Administrator privileges |
| "File not found" | Check CSV file path and existence |
| "Invalid IP address" | Use valid IPv4 format (e.g., 192.168.1.1) |
