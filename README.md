# Cybersecurity Projects Repository

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Projects repository! In this repository, I will be uploading various projects related to cybersecurity. These projects will span multiple areas of cybersecurity, including offensive security, network security, penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and much more. The goal of this repo is to showcase my hands-on experience and my continuous learning journey in the cybersecurity field.

## Projects

This repository will contain different projects, some of which may include:

- **Enigma Machine Simulation**: A Python-based simulation of the famous Enigma encryption machine.
- **Port Vulnerability Scanner**: A tool built with Python to scan network ports for vulnerabilities and assess network security.
- Other cybersecurity-related projects and tools as I learn and grow in the field.
